#Overview

In this research, a comprehensive exploration of the dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) within the context of neural networks was conducted, with a specific focus on the evolution of strategies when agents possess the flexibility to switch strategies. While fundamental applications of the PD yield valuable insights, it was ventured into a more intriguing dimension, where the study centered on how repeated PD scenarios transform when agents have the capacity to dynamically alter their strategies.
